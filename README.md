Additional information on the concepts covered (and many others) can be found in these books:

-  [Data-Driven Science and Engineering](https://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/mathematics/computational-science/data-driven-science-and-engineering-machine-learning-dynamical-systems-and-control?format=HB) by Brunton and Kutz. This excellent book covers all the topics of these notebooks and contains many Matlab examples.
